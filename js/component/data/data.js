First of all, I write emails in English to send cover letters or scholarship application to international organizations or universities. Besides, If I have free time, I go to Hoan Kiem lake and talk with foreign tourists in English to exchange cultures, improve my speaking skill and expand my knowledge. Traveling abroad is one of my hobbies. I used to go to China, Indonesia and Malaysia, most of the time I spoke English with my companions or the volunteers in those countries. Sometimes, I met local people there but actually they can’t speak English. Fortunately, supporters here helped me to translate and convey my ideas. And last but not least, understanding English, I can read English news, books or movies. Thanks to English, I can see the world outside.",

                1: "Many years ago, I was a radio announcer. At least twice every hour that I was broadcasting I was required to announce the time. If it was 1:45 in the afternoon, I would tell my listeners, “It’s fifteen minutes in front of the hour of two o’clock! The afternoon is just spinning by. Now, before you spin that dial, let’s play some more music!”",
                2: "Okay, it was a bit cheesy. However, it gave my listeners the exact time of day and segued into the next song. I once announced that it was 4 o’clock. Incredibly, in less than two minutes, someone called the station to ask if it was 4 a.m. or 4 p.m. Now, anyone looking out their window should be able to tell if it was 4 in the morning since it would be completely dark out at that hour. But, no. The station manager told me that I should never assume that my listeners can look out a window and that I always needed to let them know the exact time of day. Lesson learned.",
                3: "You may have also noticed that there are numerous ways to announce the time. The examples I gave are just a few of many. And, as with so many things that Americans and Brits disagree on, English speakers make telling time confusing.",
                4: "We use a 12-hour clock system in Britain and the U.S. for telling time, but some industries in Britain use the older, established 24-hour clock. You’ll hear the BBC use it. Midnight is 00:00 GMT. If it is 4 p.m. in the states, it would be 16:00 hours, GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). At least with that method, nobody would have to look out their window to tell if it was morning or afternoon!",
